## L1 Overview, History and Newtonian Mechanics Review
A Brief History of Dynamics<br>
Robot Dynamics Algorithms<br>
### What Are We Doing Here?
- Rigid and multi-body dynamics with constraints contact
- Classical analytical methods (Lagrange,Hamilton,etc.)
- Modern algorithmic approaches(Discrete Mechanicsï¼Œ Linear-Time Algorithms,Time-Stepping Methods)
- Focus on numerical implementation and robotics applications
## L2 State Spacce, Energy, and Lyapunov Stability

## L3 Local Stability and Runge-Kutta Methods
if you hava a non-linear system you can linearize it about something and check the eigenvalues of that Jacobian matrix and those will tell you about local stability and basically you know in continuous time you're checking with the real parts are negative.<br>
In discrete time you're taking that the modulus is less than one right so it's a contraction.<br>
It's kind of closely related to these sort of old school size of control ideas we're kind of trying to shape the eigenvalues.
